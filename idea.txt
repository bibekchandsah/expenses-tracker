show/hide sidebar
show tooltip on hover of sidebar icons
show user profile picture in sidebar
add logout button in sidebar
add tools page with calculator, currency converter, loan calculator, etc.

add it to lent, expense and for me entry form
add search functionality to expenses, loans and bank entries
create a yearly summary page with total expenses, loans, savings, etc. and graphs
user can choose the year in their profile settings and the dashboard and summary page will show data for that year by default so that in the future when they have multiple years of data, they can easily switch between years to see their financial history and progress over time. when user choose 2026 in profile settings, the dashboard and summary page will show data for 2026 by default. user can still change the year on the dashboard and summary page to view data for other years, but it will always default to the year they selected in their profile settings when they first visit those pages. this allows users to easily focus on their current year's financial data while still having access to their historical data when needed.

show the user selected currency type in the profile page and use it throughout the app for displaying amounts. user can choose from a list of common currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) or enter a custom currency code. the selected currency will be saved in their profile and used as the default currency for all financial data displayed in the app, including expenses, budgets, bank entries, etc. this way users can see their financial data in their preferred currency format and easily track their finances without having to manually convert amounts.



setup firebase hosting and deploy the app
-----Set Up Firebase (one-time)-----

Step 1: Create Firebase Project
Go to console.firebase.google.com
Click "Add project" → name it (e.g. expenseiq) → Create
On the left sidebar:
    Authentication → Get started → Google → Enable → Save
    Firestore Database → Create database → Production mode → Pick a region → Enable

Step 2: Get your Firebase config
In Firebase Console → Project Settings (gear icon) → "Your apps" → click </> (Web)
Register app (name it anything) → copy the firebaseConfig values
Fill in your .env file:
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123

-----Deploy to Vercel-----
Step 3: Deploy on Vercel
Go to vercel.com → Sign up/login with your GitHub account
Click "Add New Project" → Import your GitHub repository
In "Environment Variables", add all 6 variables from your .env:
Click "Deploy" — Vercel auto-detects Vite
Your app gets a public URL like https://your-app.vercel.app

Step 4: Allow the Vercel domain in Firebase ⚠️ Critical
Without this step, Google login will fail for everyone.
Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
Click "Add domain"
Enter your Vercel URL: your-app.vercel.app





implemented
-----------------------
Page	Features
Login	Google Sign-In, branded split layout
Dashboard	4 stat cards, bar/pie/area charts, recent transactions
Expenses	CRUD, search, filters (category/date), sort, pagination, CSV export
Categories	Default + custom categories with icon/color pickers
Budget	Per-category monthly budgets, progress bars, over-budget alerts
Profile	Display name, currency setting, account stats

What the Bank page includes:
Custom dropdown to switch between banks, with edit/delete per bank
Add Bank modal — name + opening balance
4 summary cards — Opening Balance, Total Deposits, Total Withdrawals, Current Balance
Statement table — Date | Description | Deposit (+green) | Withdraw (−red) | Closing Balance (running)
Deposit / Withdraw toggle in the entry modal — one amount field, color-coded
Edit & Delete per row (hover to reveal actions)
Totals row at the bottom of the table
CSV export of the full statement
Full dark mode support
Pagination (each month per page)
Each month is its own page — February 2026, January 2026, etc.
Newest month shown first by default; use ← Older / Newer → buttons at the bottom to navigate
The totals row at the bottom of the table shows that month's deposits, withdrawals, and closing balance — not all-time totals (those remain in the 4 summary cards at the top)
Switching banks auto-resets to the newest month for that bank
Months with no entries simply don't appear as pages — only months that actually have transactions are navigable
"All Months" button appears in the action bar whenever there are 2+ months of data — toggles between monthly view and full view
In All Months mode:
    Every month is shown as a labelled section with a blue header (e.g. "FEBRUARY 2026")
    Each month has its own subtotal row (deposits, withdrawals, closing balance for that month)
    A Grand Total row at the very bottom shows all-time totals across every month
    The ← Older / Newer → navigation is hidden (not needed)
Button label switches to "Monthly View" while in all-months mode to toggle back
Search input sits at the top of the statement table, spanning full width with a magnifier icon and a clear (×) button
Searches across all entries (not just the current month) — matches on description, date (YYYY-MM-DD), deposit amount, and withdraw amount
While searching, results are shown grouped by month with month headers (same as All Months view), so you can see which month each result belongs to
Clearing the search returns to whichever view was active (monthly or all-months)
Month navigation (← Older / Newer →) is hidden while a search is active
Typing also resets to the first results page automatically
hovering over any truncated description now shows a native browser tooltip with the full text.
Every column header (Date, Description, Deposit, Withdraw, Balance) is now a clickable button
Click once → sort ascending (↑ arrow, column label turns blue)
Click again → sort descending (↓ arrow)
Click a third time → reset to default order (⇅ icon, label returns to grey)
Click a different column → sorts that column ascending and resets the previous one
Sorting applies within each month group (so months stay grouped in All Months / search view, but entries inside each month are reordered)
The Actions column is non-sortable (no button)


Lend feature is now fully implemented with the following features:
4 stat cards (Total Lent, Returned, To Receive, People count)
Sortable main table: Date | Name | Lent | Reason | Returned | Due | Description | Actions
cycle works correctly for every column:
    1st click → descending (↓)
    2nd click → ascending (↑)
    3rd click → resets to default (⇅, natural Firestore order)
Click any name in the table to filter by that person
Person Summary panel (right side, collapsible on mobile): grouped by name, sorted by most owed first, green checkmark when settled / orange alert when pending, click to filter table
Add/Edit modal with name autocomplete (suggests previous names)
Confirm delete dialog
The bar chart is now rendered below the Person Summary panel with:
    Light purple (#c4b5fd) — represents the total lent amount, scaled so the largest lender fills the full width
    Dark purple (#7c3aed) — overlaid on top showing the returned portion as a progress fill
    Each bar shows returned / lent amounts as a label on the right
    Clicking any bar also filters the main table by that person (same behavior as the summary panel above)
Toggle button (PanelRightClose / PanelRightOpen) now sits at the right end of the search bar. Clicking it hides the entire right panel and the main table expands to full width, click again to bring it back.


Loan feature is now fully implemented with the following features:
Stats: Total Borrowed / Paid Back / To Pay / Lenders count
Table: Date | Name | Borrowed | Reason | Paid | Due | Description | Actions
Lender Summary panel (right): grouped by lender name, showing total borrowed, due, settled status
Borrowed vs Paid bar chart: same light/dark purple bars
All features: sort, search, person filter, side panel toggle, autocomplete, confirm delete


Features on the Saving page:
Stats strip: Total Spent, Total Sourced, Net Balance, Savings Rate %
Main table: Date | Amount | Expend On | Description — sortable columns, search, add/edit/delete
Right panel (toggleable with PanelRightClose/PanelRightOpen): Independent CRUD table of savings sources — Date | Amount | Description, with hover actions
Two separate modals for each table
Colored stat cards (matching Loan page style):
    Total Spent — plain white/gray
    Total Sourced — green
    Net Balance — blue (positive) / red (negative), dynamic
    Savings Rate — purple
Table upgraded to Loan-style:
Responsive 12-col grid layout (not <table>)
Sticky column headers with SortBtn component (sort arrows show active column)
Row hover actions fade in on hover (opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100)
Footer totals row showing record count + sum of filtered amounts
Empty state with centered search icon
Uses shared formatCurrency / formatDate utilities
Proper validation errors in modals with ConfirmDialog component (same as Loan)
Toast notifications on add/update/delete


Note page features:
Quick-add bar — click "Take a note..." to expand inline; auto-saves on close
Google Keep-style masonry grid with pin/archive/delete/color-change actions appearing on hover
9 color themes — default, red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple, pink
Pin/Unpin — pinned notes float to a separate "Pinned" section
Archive — archive removes notes from main view; toggle Archive button reveals them separately
Search — real-time filter by title + content
Sort — Last edited / Date created / Title A→Z dropdown
Grid ↔ List view toggle
Edit modal — click any card to open full-screen edit with color picker + pin toggle
Delete with confirmation dialog
Toast notifications on all actions
Firestore rule added for notes/{noteId}, NoteProvider wired in App.jsx, "Note" nav item in Sidebar
Cancel button → always calls reset() — discards without saving
Escape key → same, discards without saving
Clicking outside → still auto-saves (intentional)
