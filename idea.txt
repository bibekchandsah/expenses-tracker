show/hide sidebar
show tooltip on hover of sidebar icons
show user profile picture in sidebar
add logout button in sidebar
add tools page with calculator, currency converter, loan calculator, etc.

add it to loan, expense and given entry form
add search functionality to expenses, loans and bank entries
create a yearly summary page with total expenses, loans, savings, etc. and graphs
user can choose the year in their profile settings and the dashboard and summary page will show data for that year by default so that in the future when they have multiple years of data, they can easily switch between years to see their financial history and progress over time. when user choose 2026 in profile settings, the dashboard and summary page will show data for 2026 by default. user can still change the year on the dashboard and summary page to view data for other years, but it will always default to the year they selected in their profile settings when they first visit those pages. this allows users to easily focus on their current year's financial data while still having access to their historical data when needed.

show the user selected currency type in the profile page and use it throughout the app for displaying amounts. user can choose from a list of common currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.) or enter a custom currency code. the selected currency will be saved in their profile and used as the default currency for all financial data displayed in the app, including expenses, budgets, bank entries, etc. this way users can see their financial data in their preferred currency format and easily track their finances without having to manually convert amounts.



setup firebase hosting and deploy the app
-----Set Up Firebase (one-time)-----

Step 1: Create Firebase Project
Go to console.firebase.google.com
Click "Add project" → name it (e.g. expenseiq) → Create
On the left sidebar:
    Authentication → Get started → Google → Enable → Save
    Firestore Database → Create database → Production mode → Pick a region → Enable

Step 2: Get your Firebase config
In Firebase Console → Project Settings (gear icon) → "Your apps" → click </> (Web)
Register app (name it anything) → copy the firebaseConfig values
Fill in your .env file:
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123

-----Deploy to Vercel-----
Step 3: Deploy on Vercel
Go to vercel.com → Sign up/login with your GitHub account
Click "Add New Project" → Import your GitHub repository
In "Environment Variables", add all 6 variables from your .env:
Click "Deploy" — Vercel auto-detects Vite
Your app gets a public URL like https://your-app.vercel.app

Step 4: Allow the Vercel domain in Firebase ⚠️ Critical
Without this step, Google login will fail for everyone.
Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
Click "Add domain"
Enter your Vercel URL: your-app.vercel.app

What the Bank page includes:

Totals row at the bottom of the table
CSV export of the full statement
Full dark mode support
Pagination (each month per page)
Each month is its own page — February 2026, January 2026, etc.
Newest month shown first by default; use ← Older / Newer → buttons at the bottom to navigate
The totals row at the bottom of the table shows that month's deposits, withdrawals, and closing balance — not all-time totals (those remain in the 4 summary cards at the top)
Switching banks auto-resets to the newest month for that bank
Months with no entries simply don't appear as pages — only months that actually have transactions are navigable
"All Months" button appears in the action bar whenever there are 2+ months of data — toggles between monthly view and full view
In All Months mode:
    Every month is shown as a labelled section with a blue header (e.g. "FEBRUARY 2026")
    Each month has its own subtotal row (deposits, withdrawals, closing balance for that month)
    A Grand Total row at the very bottom shows all-time totals across every month
    The ← Older / Newer → navigation is hidden (not needed)
Button label switches to "Monthly View" while in all-months mode to toggle back
