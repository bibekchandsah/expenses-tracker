setup firebase hosting and deploy the app
-----Set Up Firebase (one-time)-----

Step 1: Create Firebase Project
Go to console.firebase.google.com
Click "Add project" → name it (e.g. expenseiq) → Create
On the left sidebar:
    Authentication → Get started → Google → Enable → Save
    Firestore Database → Create database → Production mode → Pick a region → Enable

Step 2: Get your Firebase config
In Firebase Console → Project Settings (gear icon) → "Your apps" → click </> (Web)
Register app (name it anything) → copy the firebaseConfig values
Fill in your .env file:
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123

-----Deploy to Vercel-----
Step 3: Deploy on Vercel
Go to vercel.com → Sign up/login with your GitHub account
Click "Add New Project" → Import your GitHub repository
In "Environment Variables", add all 6 variables from your .env:
Click "Deploy" — Vercel auto-detects Vite
Your app gets a public URL like https://your-app.vercel.app

What the Bank page includes:
Custom dropdown to switch between banks, with edit/delete per bank
Add Bank modal — name + opening balance
4 summary cards — Opening Balance, Total Deposits, Total Withdrawals, Current Balance
Statement table — Date | Description | Deposit (+green) | Withdraw (−red) | Closing Balance (running)
Deposit / Withdraw toggle in the entry modal — one amount field, color-coded
Edit & Delete per row (hover to reveal actions)
Totals row at the bottom of the table
CSV export of the full statement
Full dark mode support
Pagination (each month per page)
Each month is its own page — February 2026, January 2026, etc.
Newest month shown first by default; use ← Older / Newer → buttons at the bottom to navigate
The totals row at the bottom of the table shows that month's deposits, withdrawals, and closing balance — not all-time totals (those remain in the 4 summary cards at the top)
Switching banks auto-resets to the newest month for that bank
Months with no entries simply don't appear as pages — only months that actually have transactions are navigable
"All Months" button appears in the action bar whenever there are 2+ months of data — toggles between monthly view and full view
In All Months mode:
    Every month is shown as a labelled section with a blue header (e.g. "FEBRUARY 2026")
    Each month has its own subtotal row (deposits, withdrawals, closing balance for that month)
    A Grand Total row at the very bottom shows all-time totals across every month
    The ← Older / Newer → navigation is hidden (not needed)
Button label switches to "Monthly View" while in all-months mode to toggle back
Search input sits at the top of the statement table, spanning full width with a magnifier icon and a clear (×) button
Searches across all entries (not just the current month) — matches on description, date (YYYY-MM-DD), deposit amount, and withdraw amount
While searching, results are shown grouped by month with month headers (same as All Months view), so you can see which month each result belongs to
Clearing the search returns to whichever view was active (monthly or all-months)
Month navigation (← Older / Newer →) is hidden while a search is active
Typing also resets to the first results page automatically
hovering over any truncated description now shows a native browser tooltip with the full text.
Every column header (Date, Description, Deposit, Withdraw, Balance) is now a clickable button
Click once → sort ascending (↑ arrow, column label turns blue)
Click again → sort descending (↓ arrow)
Click a third time → reset to default order (⇅ icon, label returns to grey)
Click a different column → sorts that column ascending and resets the previous one
Sorting applies within each month group (so months stay grouped in All Months / search view, but entries inside each month are reordered)
The Actions column is non-sortable (no button)


Lend feature is now fully implemented with the following features:
4 stat cards (Total Lent, Returned, To Receive, People count)

    Dark purple (#7c3aed) — overlaid on top showing the returned portion as a progress fill
    Each bar shows returned / lent amounts as a label on the right
    Clicking any bar also filters the main table by that person (same behavior as the summary panel above)
Toggle button (PanelRightClose / PanelRightOpen) now sits at the right end of the search bar. Clicking it hides the entire right panel and the main table expands to full width, click again to bring it back.

editing name, emoji, color, should reflect changes in expenses


Expenses page updates:
Title/Date(4) | Amount(2) | Category(2) | Note(2) | Actions(2)
The 12-column grid is currently full (4+2+2+2+2). I'll compress Title/Date to 3 and Actions to 1 to make room for a Description column.
Title / Date → Amount → Note → Description → Category → Actions
The filter panel now has 4 fields: Category → Month → From → To. Selecting a month (e.g. 2026-03) instantly narrows results to that month, and it works alongside the other filters. The month filter also activates the blue dot indicator and the
The search box now matches against all of: title, date, amount, note, description, and category name. The results count in the header also updates accordingly.
Column sort now follows the 3-click cycle:
    Click	State	        Icon
    1st	    Descending ↓	↓ (blue)
    2nd	    Ascending ↑	    ↑ (blue)
    3rd	    Reset	        ⇅ (grey)
"Expenses by Category" section now appears in Net Summary (above the monthly breakdown), with:
Left: scrollable table showing each category's icon, name, and total spent — plus a grand total row in the footer
Right: horizontal bar chart with each bar colored using the category's own color, sized dynamically to fit all categories
A Monthly Breakdown table now appears below the expense list with:
    Month column — current month has a blue dot indicator
    Transactions column — count of entries for that month
    Total column — sum for that month
    Total row in the footer — grand total of transactions and amount across all shown months
The table respects whatever filters/search are active, so filtering by category or date range will update the breakdown accordingly. Most recent month is shown first.


Dashboard page updates:
Category Breakdown toggle — now defaults to Monthly with a Monthly / Yearly pill toggle in the top-right corner of the chart card. Switching to Yearly aggregates all expenses from the current year.
Monthly Expenses showing current month — the root cause was a timezone bug: new Date().toISOString() converts to UTC, so in Nepal (UTC+5:45) "March 1 local" = "Feb 28 UTC", making March invisible. 
The Spending Trend chart now has a 6 Months / 1 Year toggle in the top-right corner — defaults to 6 months, switching to 1 Year shows all 12 months.
Bank Trend area chart now appears below Spending Trend with:
    Green area — monthly deposit totals
    Red area — monthly withdrawal totals
    6 Months / 1 Year toggle (same as spending trend)
    Title shows the currently selected bank name (e.g. "Bank Trend — My SBI Account")
    Legend labels "Deposit" and "Withdraw"
The Bank Trend card now shows a bank selector dropdown in the header when you have multiple banks — switching it instantly updates the chart without leaving the dashboard. If you only have one bank, the name is shown as plain text.
income trend line chart added below the bank trend with:
    Green line — monthly income totals
    6 Months / 1 Year toggle (same as spending trend)
    Title "Income Trend"
    Legend label "Income"


Income page features:
4 stat cards: Total Income, This Month, Avg/Month, Entry count
Table with sortable columns: Title/Date, Amount, Notes, Description, Source, Actions
3-state sort cycle (↓ → ↑ → reset), same as Expenses
Filters: Source, Month, From, To with active indicator
Full-text search across all fields
Color-coded source badges (Salary, Freelance, Business, Investment, Rental, Gift, Other)
Monthly breakdown table at the bottom (bank-statement style, current month highlighted in green)
CSV export
Pagination (30 per page) > per month if more than 30 entries


Expenses and Income pages:
Behavior logic (PAGE_SIZE raised from 15 → 30):
    ≤ 30 entries → normal pagination (Prev / Next, 30 per page)
    30 entries → pagination disappears; rows are grouped under month header bands
Month header band shows:
    Month name (e.g. March 2026)
    Entry count and total amount for that month (right-aligned)
Entries within each month group are sorted newest-first (same as the existing sort). The existing Monthly Breakdown summary table at the bottom still appears as before.


import button to (income, expenses, bank, lend, loan, saving, for me)pages to import from CSV file exported from other apps like Splitwise, Google Sheets, etc. with mapping of columns to date (supports YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, all format), amount, source, description fields. this will make it easier for users to migrate their existing data into the app without having to manually enter each record. the import process should also handle duplicates gracefully (e.g. by skipping or updating existing records based on a unique identifier) and provide feedback on how many records were imported successfully vs skipped due to duplicates or errors. ask user to confirm the duplicate insertion before proceeding to avoid accidental overwrites.
Upload — drag & drop or file picker, CSV validation
Map Columns — auto-guesses column mapping, per-field dropdowns, date format selector (8 formats + auto-detect), 5-row preview table
Review — new / duplicate / invalid counts; duplicate handling radio (skip or import anyway); expandable lists for duplicates and invalid rows
Result — imported / skipped / failed summary
Date formats supported: YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD, MM-DD-YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, D MMM YYYY, MMM D YYYY, plus JS Date.parse fallback.
Import wired into all 7 pages:
    Page	    Button	                                Duplicate key
    Income	    Upload + green accent	                title|date|amount
    Expenses	Upload + category name-matching	        title|date|amount
    Bank	    Upload + CR/DR type column support	    description|date|deposit|withdraw
    Lend	    Upload	                                name|date|amount
    Loan	    Upload	                                name|date|amount
    Saving	    Upload	                                expendOn|date|amount
    For Me	    Upload + pink accent	                name|date|amount
Bank entries support both split-column CSVs (separate deposit/withdraw) and single-amount-with-type-column CSVs (e.g. Splitwise, bank exports with CR/DR).


add tools page with draggable & resizable calculator like ios support keyboard keys too, currency converter, loan calculator, etc.
Calculator
iOS-style dark design (#1C1C1E background, orange operators, gray function keys)
Draggable — grab the header bar and drag anywhere on screen
Resizable — drag the bottom-right corner handle (min 280×440, max 560×900)
Rendered via createPortal to document.body so it floats above everything
Keyboard support (only when no text input is focused):
    Key	        Action
    0–9	        digit input
    .	        decimal
    + - * /	    operator

add it (plus icon) to income, expenses, bank, lend, loan, saving, for me pages to quickly add an entry to those pages without having to go through the full add entry modal. this quick-add clicks "Add", the entry should be created immediately and the form should reset for the next entry. this will allow users to quickly log their transactions on the go without interrupting their workflow or having to navigate away from the current page.

income/loan/saving ↔ bank(deposit) -> choose bank
expense/lend ↔ bank(withdraw) -> choose bank
for expenses use title value as description in bank entry
from any page if user want to insert it to bank then ask for which bank and then insert it in that bank

pages = income, expenses, bank, lend, loan, saving, for me
income table heading = title/date, amount, notes, description, source
expense table heading = title/date, amount, note, description, category
bank table heading = date, description, deposit, withdraw, closing balance
lend table heading = date, name, lent, reason, returned, due, description
loan table heading = date, name, borrowed, reason, paid, due, description
saving table heading = date, amount, expend on, description
for me table heading = date, amount, name, description
if both page have same heading then insert data in same column otherwise use validation rule:

valid
----------
expend on/ reason -> note/notes
withdraw/deposit -> amount
lent/borrowed -> amount
name -> notes/note/description (whichever is empty, if not don't insert in notes/description to avoid overwriting existing data)

not valid
----------
source != category of income & expense
closing balance = don't use closing balance as it can be calculated from deposit and withdraw
if one table has 5 columns and other has 4 columns then use the common columns to insert data and ignore the extra column in the table which has more columns to avoid overwriting existing data


create a yearly summary page with total expenses, loans, savings, etc. and graphs
user can choose the year in their profile settings and the dashboard and summary page will show data for that year by default so that in the future when they have multiple years of data, they can easily switch between years to see their financial history and progress over time. when user choose 2026 in profile settings, the dashboard and summary page will show data for 2026 by default. user can still change the year on the dashboard and summary page to view data for other years, but it will always default to the year they selected in their profile settings when they first visit those pages. this allows users to easily focus on their current year's financial data while still having access to their historical data when needed.

delete/export data of selected year
